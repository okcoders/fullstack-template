# Express Starter Template

This is a very basic express app, with minimal setup, and with the intent of only server json api responses.

## Getting project running

After cloning or download the project, run:

```
npm install
```

To start developing, run:

```
npm start
```

## Setting up the db

in the server/db/database.js file, there is a url currently using localhost - change this to your mongodb connection url
